# MLOPS-DSTI  
  
Combining development and operations (DevOps) is an approach to shorten the development life cycle
and improve software quality while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment
with business objectives. We will learn its most important building blocks, before extending it to the
usage in data science (MLOps). A machine learning model is only valuable once it can be used to
generate business value. We will go through the steps of the ML lifecycle from development
to production. We will learn how versioning and testing help us achieve reproducible data science, and
how to leverage automation to speed up the delivery of the pipelines. We will deploy our model to
Heroku platform and discuss how models should be monitored after deployment.
